This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Elixir where using Process.exit inside an Enum.each loop can lead to unexpected behavior. The loop terminates before completing all iterations because Process.exit kills the current process. The solution shows how to use a try-catch block to handle exceptions gracefully or to refactor the code to avoid the premature termination of the loop.  This is important to understand for writing robust and predictable Elixir code.
